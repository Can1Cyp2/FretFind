# FretFind Progress Report

Deliverable 1 (d1): Basic Project Outline  
Date range: May 27, 2026 - June 8, 2026

This document is the main progress tracker for the project. It keeps track of the current deliverables, for this one: document the project direction, define the basic API/classes, create a tiny hardcoded proof of concept, and verify it with a few simple tests.

## Project Purpose

FretFind is a React Native and Expo app for reverse guitar chord finding. Instead of searching for a chord name first, the user selects notes on a virtual fretboard and the app identifies the chord being played.

The larger project goal is to help guitarists learn:
- Fretboard navigation and note recognition.
- Chord construction.
- Intervals and chord formulas.
- Inversions and slash chords.
- Alternate tunings.
- How chords fit into progressions.

## Current Scope

The full project will eventually have an expanded directory structure (currently empty folders, not listed below), this deliverable only adds files for what is needed right now.

Current implementation files:

```txt
src/
  controllers/
    FretboardInteractionController.ts
    ChordAnalysisController.ts
    ProgressionController.ts
  mockData.ts
  scripts/
    mockProgression.ts
  tests/
    basicControllers.mock.test.ts
```

Supporting files:

```txt
README.md
LICENSE
documents/progress.md
tsconfig.mock.json
```

## API And Class Contract

The current "API" is local TypeScript only. There is no server and no real backend yet.

### Mock Data

```ts
type FretSelection = {
  string: number;
  fret: number;
  note: string;
};

```

The current mock shape is an open C major chord:

```txt
C - E - G - C - E
```

The current mock progression is:

```txt
C - Am - F - G
```

The current candidate chord is:
```txt
Em 
```

### Controller Classes:

`FretboardInteractionController`

```ts
selectFrets(selections: FretSelection[]): FretSelection[]
getSelectedNotes(): string[]
```

`ChordAnalysisController`

```ts
identifyChord(selectedNotes: string[]): ChordAnalysisResult
```

`ProgressionController`

```ts
analyzeProgression(
  progression: string[],
  candidateChord: string
): ProgressionAnalysisResult
```

## Functionality Definition

The proof of concept does three basic things:

1. Stores a hardcoded fret selection.
2. Reads the selected note names.
3. Identifies `C - E - G - C - E` as a C major chord.
4. Explains that `Em` can fit inside `C - Am - F - G`.

The logic is intentionally hardcoded. This is only meant to prove the shape of the interaction before building the full engine.

## Proof Of Concept Output

Expected chord result:

```txt
Selected notes: C - E - G - C - E
Best match: C
Quality: perfect
Formula: 1 - 3 - 5
Explanation: The selected notes contain C, E, and G, which form a C major triad.
```

Expected progression result:

```txt
Progression: C - Am - F - G
Candidate chord: Em
Fits: yes
Summary: Em can work inside this C major progression.
```

 #### Output: Verification passed, the output matches the expected results above. Screenshot of output can be found in file: `\documents\may27-jun8\Output_Screenshot.png`

## Testing

The mock test checks:

1. `FretboardInteractionController` returns `C - E - G - C - E`.
2. `ChordAnalysisController` identifies the result as `C`.
3. `ChordAnalysisController` marks the match as `perfect`.
4. `ProgressionController` says `Em` fits the mock progression.
5. `ProgressionController` returns at least one reason.

Run:

```bash
npm run test:mock
```

Print the mock result:

```bash
npm run mock:progression
```

## Wireframes

Text version of wireframes for simplicity but I will add photo mockups in a seperate document.

### Fretboard And Result

```txt
[FretFind]

Selected frets:
String 5 fret 3 -> C
String 4 fret 2 -> E
String 3 fret 0 -> G
String 2 fret 1 -> C
String 1 fret 0 -> E

[Analyze]

Result:
C major
Formula: 1 - 3 - 5
```

### Progression Explanation

```txt
[Progression]

[ C] -> [ Am ] -> [ F ] -> [G]

Candidate chord: Em

Result:
Em can fit inside this C major progression.

Reasons (in the future, this will be more detailed and educational, so a simpler explanation, with a more in depth one available as well):
- Em belongs naturally to the C major key area.
- Em shares E and G with C.
- Shared tones can make chord movement sound smoother.
```
